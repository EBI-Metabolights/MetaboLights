Select the  Aspera Upload option and then Install the plugin. Aspera is a fast way of transferring files which also enables the user to stop the transfer, and later resume where you left off. If you see raw data files in the final upload with .aspx appended, the file upload may have paused. Please open Aspera connect on your computer to check the status of your upload and resume upload if necessary. If the upload has completed you can delete the .aspx appended files or contact us to do so. NB. You may need to contact your local IT support if you do not have privileges to install browser plugins.<br><br>(2) <b><i>FTP</b></i><br>FTP can be used on any computer, either directly from the command line or through a graphical user interface. However, on most computers, you have to install an FTP client first. If you are not familiar with using FTP from the command line, we can recommend the free FileZilla tool.

This is the first European wide change in data handling legislation 1995. Current legislation varies from country to country which leads to differences as to how data was handled. The GDPR needs no national legislation and provides a consistent framework across Europe as to how data must be handled.<br><br>\n\nSince the GDPR regulations came into effect in May 2018 we have not observed significant changes in the submissions of human studies, many of which are urine, blood or tissue based. Within a submission, there are varying levels of data requirement. Our primary requirement is the raw data set and, where we encourage as complete corresponding metadata as possible for the purposes of reanalysis, our basic requirement would involve only the accompanying organism and organism part. Further information regarding the submission process can be viewed on our help page and the institute's data protection policy can be found here.<br><br>\n\nIn response to the wider metabolomics profile ethical debate and its increasing importance in clinical research, we are developing a controlled access version of MetaboLights. This will allow researchers to submit more restricted data which will then be available to others through ethics board approval, however, this will not be in place until 2021 at the earliest. This will follow the model of the already existing European Genome-Phenome Archive (Submission FAQs and GDPR notice).<br><br>\n\nFind more about <a target='_blank' href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/technology/2017/04/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/ '>EBI GDPR policy</a>.",
