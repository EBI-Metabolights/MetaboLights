Dear {1},

Thank you for your interest in MetaboLights

Your new MetaboLights account "{0}" has been activated and is ready to use.

Here is a quick start guide, but please let us know on metabolights-help@ebi.ac.uk if we can help you further.

Quick start guide:
- We use our own version of ISAcreator to capture metabolomics metadata and raw files, which needs to be downloaded and installed. You can download a complete package from our ftp link here: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metabolights/submissionTool/ISAcreatorMetaboLights.zip
- Once downloaded and unzipped, go to the ISAcreatorMetaboLights directory and use one of the supplied scripts to start ISAcreator. Please use "run_WIN.cmd" on Windows, "run_MAC.command" on Mac or "run_LINUX.sh" on Linux, this is a requirement to pass online validation and will preserve all special characters
- Before you start creating a new study, please read our comprehensive documentation and steps of how to create and set up a new study: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/help
- Our submission page is at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/presubmit

If you would like to occasionally receive general announcements emails from MetaboLights, please subscribe to our MetaboLights-Announce email distribution list here: https://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/metabolights-announce


Best wishes
