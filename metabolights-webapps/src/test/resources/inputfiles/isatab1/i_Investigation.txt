Study Title	"The Influence of Pharmacogenetics on Fatty Liver Disease in the Wistar and Kyoto Rats:  A Combined Transcriptomic and Metabonomic"
Study Submission Date	"12/10/2004"
Study Public Release Date	"10/03/2009"
Study Description	"Although fatty liver disease is caused by a number of toxicological insults and the metabolic syndrome, the exact mechanisms by which many of these pathophysiological stimulii induce fatty liver are unknown. The rapid and profound steatosis caused by orotic acid, resulting from an impairment in the production of ApoB, has been investigated in the Wistar strain rat using a combined transcriptomic and metabonomic/metabolomic approach. Analysis of liver tissue from rats exposed to orotic acid for 1, 3, and 14 days was performed by DNA microarrays and high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy based metabonomics of both tissue extracts and intact tissue (n = 3). Data were analyzed using a combination of ANOVA and principal components analysis, used as a data reduction tool to visualize the most perturbed transcripts and metabolites. Orotic acid produced a profound 8-fold increase in total lipids, and in particular increases in resonances associated with polyunsaturated fats (CHCH and CH2CHCH groups). This was accompanied by increases in the concentrations of trimethylamine-oxide (TMAO), betaine, choline, and phosphocholine, as well as a relative decrease in glucose and glycogen. At the transcriptional level, perturbations were detected in both oxidative stress and osmoregulation/pH homeostasis. However, this contrasts with a previous transcriptomic/metabolic study of fatty liver disease in a combined data set of Wistar (out-bred) and Kyoto (in-bred) strains of rats, with only 4 transcripts being found to be in common between the two analyses. This emphasizes the need to understand how strain background interacts with a given toxic lesion or genetic modification.

Study Protocol Description	"All animal procedures conformed to Home Office, UK, guidelines for animal welfare. Male Wistar rats (n = 3 for each time point; control animals fed control diet for the same time period; Charles River UK Ltd.) were fed either standard laboratory chow, or chow supplemented with 1 % orotic acid (Sigma Aldrich, UK) ad libitum. 5-6 Rats were killed by cervical dislocation at days 0, 1, 3 and 14, and the left lateral lobe of the liver excised. Tissues were snap frozen and stored at -80 C."	"Total RNA was extracted by RNA Isolation Kit (Stratagene) from the livers of Wistar rats at day 0 (n = 3), day 1 and 3 (n = 2), and day 14 (n = 3)."	"Biotinylated cRNA was prepared following the guidelines described by Affymetrix."	"Biotinylated cRNA probes was hybridized following the guidelines described by Affymetrix."	"GeneChips were scanning following the guidelines described by Affymetrix using Affymetrix Scanner."	"CEL were normalized using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 application"	"Extracts were prepared (n = 3 for each time point) using an acetonitrile/water extraction procedure as previously described and reconstituted in D2O containing 4 mM trisilylpropionic acid (TSP)"	"Solvent suppressed spectra were acquired for tissue extracts on a 5 mm inverse geometry 1H/broadband probe into 32 k data points, averaged over 128 acquisitions."	"Intact tissue (10 mg) was examined using a high-resolution magic angle spinning (MAS) probe. Spectra were acquired at a spinning speed of 5000 Hz, and solvent suppressed spectra were averaged over 256 acquisitions."	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""
