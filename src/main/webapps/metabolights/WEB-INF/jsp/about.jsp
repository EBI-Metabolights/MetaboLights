                   Metabolights: a database for metabolomics experiments and derived information

                <div id="text-column">
                    Metabolights is a database for Metabolomics experiments and derived information.  The database is cross-species, cross-technique and covers metabolite structures and their reference spectra as well as their biological roles, locations and concentrations, and experimental data from metabolic experiments.
                    We will provide search services around spectral similarities and chemical structures.

                <div id="text-column">
                    We will also offer user-submission tools and have strong reporting capabilities.
                    We will utilise and further develop de-facto standard formats where various components are encapsulated, such as the encoded spectral and chromatographic data, and associated information about the chemical structure, as well as metadata describing assays and the study as a whole.
               </div>
                <div id="text-column">
                  Metabolights's semantic quality will be based on various controlled vocabularies linking data to existing resources such as BRENDA (tissue ontology) and other established ontologies.
                  We are dedicated to collaborate closely with major parties in world-wide metabolomics communities, such as the Metabolomics Society and the Metabolomics Standards Initiative.

                The development op Metabolights is funded by the BBSRC, grant reference <A href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/pa/grants/AwardDetails.aspx?FundingReference=BB/I000933/1">BB/I000933/1</A>.<br>
                The funding is for a project that will instantiate, at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) in Hinxton, Cambridge, UK, 
                the MetaboloLights Metabolomics database with various different components focused on both data standards 
                and primary experimental data. The resource will be cross-species, cross-application and will cover 
                all relevant analytical methods. Metabolights is being developed by the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/steinbeck/">Steinbeck group</a> at the European Bionformatics Institute.

                Experimental data gets submitted to Metabolights in <a href="http://isatab.sourceforge.net/index.html">isatab</a> format.
                The Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA) infrastructure is the first general-purpose format and freely available desktop software suite targeted to 
                experimentalists, curators and developers and that assists in the reporting and local management of experimental metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, 
                technology and measurement types, sample-to-data relationships) from studies employing one or a combination of technologies.
